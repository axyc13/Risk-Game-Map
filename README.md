# 'Risk' Game Map

This was my submission for SOFTENG281 Assignment 3. It is coded entirely in Java using OOP, Design Patterns and Data Structures such as Graphs.

The project is a reimagined 'Risk' Game map where you can visualise the path from a starting location to an ending location. 

You will also get other facts such as Most Travelled Continent and the Fuel Cost assosiate with this path.

Have Fun!
